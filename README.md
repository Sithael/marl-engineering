# Marl-Ripped-QMIX

Welcome to Marl-Revamped-QMIX, a project which is not just about implementation of the Monotonic Value Function Factorisation (QMIX) algorithm, but also about my personal journey through the fascinating world of Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). As a testament to my learning process, this repository reflects a growing understanding of complex multi-agent systems and deep learning models.

## A Learning Journey

Note on my approach to Marl-Revamped-QMIX. This isn't just a project for me, but a real learning adventure into the world of Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). I'm not chasing perfection right out of the gate here. Instead, I'm taking it slow and steady, committed to fully understanding every aspect of MARL and the QMIX algorithm.

My way of doing things? I dig deep. I mean, really deep. I've found myself reading the same academic papers over ten times just to make sure I get it. Once I feel like I've wrapped my head around the theories and concepts, I get my hands dirty and start putting those principles into practice, one small piece at a time. It's like solving a massive jigsaw puzzle, where every bit of knowledge puts me closer to seeing the big picture.

As I keep learning and growing, I have plans to beef up Marl-Revamped-QMIX. I'm looking to integrate it with cool technologies like Nvidia Isaac Gym and AWS Cloud services. This should make it a pretty handy tool for anyone interested in MARL.

## What Is QMIX?

QMIX is a renowned value-based method in the sphere of MARL, acclaimed for its superior performance in a range of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios. It cleverly combines a centralized critic with decentralized actors, allowing for effective, tractable solutions to multi-agent tasks.

The magic of QMIX lies in its unique value decomposition technique: it decomposes the joint action-value function into individual per-agent utilities. This enables decentralized policy optimization while preserving the promise of global optimality.

## Features

- **Comprehensive**: This reimplementation is as faithful as possible to the original QMIX algorithm, ensuring all its features are accurately replicated.

- **Modular design**: I have designed the project with modularity in mind. This offers high customizability to users who wish to experiment with individual components.

## Application Domains

QMIX is particularly useful for cooperative tasks requiring multiple agents to work collectively towards a common goal. The applications are varied and include collaborative games, robot teams, and autonomous driving among others.
